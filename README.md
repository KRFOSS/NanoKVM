## Introduction

Lichee NanoKVM is an IP-KVM product based on LicheeRV Nano, inheriting the extreme size and powerful features of LicheeRV Nano.

The Lichee NanoKVM is now available in three versions:

* NanoKVM-Cube Lite is a basic configuration that is suitable for individual users with certain DIY capabilities and enterprise users with bulk requirements.

* NanoKVM-Cube Full is a full version with a sophisticated case and complete accessories, as well as a built-in system mirror card that is ready to use at boot, and is recommended for individual users.

* NanoKVM-PCle is a new form with a built-in PCle baffle that can be fixed inside the chassis. NanoKVM-PCle adds optional WiFi and PoE functions based on NanoKVM-Cube; it has its own PCle slot and can draw power from the motherboard PCle slot; in addition, the wired connection (ETH) is also more stable, meeting more professional needs.

## Hardware platform NanoKVM

NanoKVM is based on Sipeed [LicheeRV Nano](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/lichee/RV_Nano/1_intro.html)，you can find specifications, schematics, and dimensional drawings [here](http://cn.dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/LICHEE/LicheeRV_Nano).

The NanoKVM Lite is constructed by the LicheeRV Nano and HDMItoCSI board, and the NanoKVM FULL adds the NanoKVM-A/B board and shell to the NanoKVM Lite. The HDMItoCSI board is used to convert the HDMI signal; NanoKVM-A, including OLED, ATX control output (USB Type-C interface), auxiliary power supply and ATX power on/off and reset buttons; The NanoKVM-B is connected to the plate at one end and the computer at the other end is connected to the computer ATX-Pin, which is used to remotely control the power of the computer.

The NanoKVM image is built on LicheeRV Nano SDK and MaixCDK, and is compatible with materials that use the LicheeRV Nano, opposite the KVM software cannot be used with the LicheeRV Nano or other SG2002 products. If you would like to build an HDMI input application on LicheeRV Nano or MaixCam, please contact us for technical support.

Note: Out of the 256MB memory in SG2002, 158MB is currently allocated for the multimedia subsystem, which NanoKVM will use for video image acquisition and processing.
